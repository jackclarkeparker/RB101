The output will be 34. The answer variable is never changed by `mess_with_it`
because the method doesn't implement with any destructive methods (not that
there are any destructive methods for Integers). The return value of the method
would be 50, but this isn't assigned to `answer`, but to `new_answer`, and the
`p` call on `line 9` is outputting `answer - 8` no `new_answer - 8`.
