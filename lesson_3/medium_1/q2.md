The statement will return a TypeError(Integer can't be coerced into String). 
The `+` operator invoked is actually a method - String#+, which takes only 
string arguments to concatenate.
Currently this code is adding an Integer to a String.

One way of fixing this would be to append Integer#to_s to the `(40 + 2)` 
expression so that String#+ would be concatenating with another string.

Another way of fixing it would be to do away with String#+ altogether and
instead interpolate the integer operation inside of the string using `#{}`

Actually, the error reads TypeError: no implicit conversion of Integer into String
