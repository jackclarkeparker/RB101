The Munster family's data got partially ransacked - the value for each members
`'gender'` was assigned to `'other'`, however the operation that reassigned 
age had no effect on the family's data.

This is because the `age` operation uses the assignment operator, which 
creates a new object and assigns it to the `family_member["age"]` pointer local
to the `mess_with_demographics` method.
The subsequent statement on `line 12` is different because it uses a setter
method which is a mutating method. The changes made to the object pointed at 
by the `family_member["gender"]` pointer are reflected by in the external 
variable, indeed the pointer is never reassigned a new object at all.

FAaaaaaa. Still don't have such a good handle on this. I saw += and thought,
HA! That's an assignment operator, I know! In reality. Because the += is 
following a reference to the value of a pair by way of element reference, the
`+=` is actually also a setter method. Both of these changes are reflected in 
the outcome.
