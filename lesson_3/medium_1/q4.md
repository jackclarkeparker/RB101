rolling_buffer1, which makes use of `<<` to append new_element to the buffer 
array will modify the buffer with each addition of a new_element, which is 
what we want here. 

rolling_buffer2 on the other hand, will initialise the buffer variable anew 
with each invocation - `new_element`'s added with each invocation will persist 
in the buffer variable for only as long as the method is being invoked. If the 
variable being assigned on `line 8` was called `input_array` this still 
wouldn't resolve the issue. It would simply point the variable within the 
array to a new object, and the input_array outside the method would remain 
unchanged.

Woops! I got a little tunnel vision here, trying to explain something. I may 
have even seen this in the beginning. `rolling_buffer2` just requires that we 
assign an external variable to its output, and then pass this same variable 
back in to point to the same object as the `input_array` parameter. If this is
done, then successive invocations of the method will carry the buffer along.
