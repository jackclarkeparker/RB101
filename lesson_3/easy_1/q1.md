What would you expect the code below to print out?

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3]
numbers.uniq

puts numbers
```

My thinking was that Integer#uniq would have no effect on the numbers object 
itself, because it's not a destructive method, unlike #uniq!

I didn't pause to consider exactly how `puts <array>` is displayed. When calling `puts` on an array, each element has #to_s called on it before being
printed on a seperate line.
`p <array>` on the other hand will call `#inspect` on the object before printing, which returns a string printable version of an object.
If you call `puts` on `<array>`.inspect, it will have the same effect.
