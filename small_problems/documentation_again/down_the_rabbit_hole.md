The documentation for YAML::load_file is found in the Psych Module. Psych is a
YAML parser and emitter. I guess Psych is Ruby's way of interfacing with this
feature of code which is external to the Ruby project. That YAML is external
might explain why Ruby doesn't work with it named directly in it's
documentation. Ruby is only implementing what is available on the web.

Here is the link to the documentation:
