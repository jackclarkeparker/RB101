# First Try (Pre Documentation check)

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr.take(2)

How does take work?
- Take returns the first n values of the receiver as a new array.
- It's opposite is drop, which removes the first n values of the receiver, and
  returns rest.

take is non-destructive. If we need help to find out how it works, we can
consult the documentation.

the code will return [1, 2]
